Data Science Exploration Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to exploring the principles of Data Science through various projects. This repository contains a collection of projects that I have worked on to develop and showcase my skills in the field of Data Science. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project:

1. Personal Loans Analysis

Project Description: In this project, I analyze a dataset related to personal loans. I explore the data to gain insights into factors affecting loan approvals and customer demographics. The goal is to build predictive models to assess credit risk and make data-driven recommendations.

Folder Name: Project 1 - Personal Loans


2. Recommendation Systems

Project Description: This project focuses on building recommendation systems. I explore different techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation to provide personalised recommendations for users based on their preferences and behaviour.

Folder Name: Project 2 - Recommendation Systems


3. Object Detection Project 1

Project Description: The first object detection project involves using computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and classify objects in images. I may use popular frameworks like opencv and models like YOLOv8 to build and train object detection models.

Folder Name: Project 3 - Object Detection - Car Counter 


4. Object Detection Project 2

Project Description: Similar to the first object detection project, this one explores different datasets, models, or use cases related to object detection. It may involve more advanced techniques or specific applications.

Folder Name: Project 4 - Object Detection - People Counter 


5. Web Scraper

Project Description: In this project, I develop a web scraper to collect data from websites. I may use libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract structured information from web pages. This data can be used for various data analysis and machine learning tasks.

Folder Name: Project 5 - Population Web Scrapper & VoiceAssistant
